title: "The Young Alliance Against Cancer (YAAC) -- Educating the next generation of cancer researchers"


The Young Alliance Against Cancer held its inaugural conference in Heidelberg, Germany from November 30th – December 2nd, 2012 

During the conference an international working group of junior cancer scientists discussed recent progress in implementing a web-based information platform for young scientists and planned the future development of the Young Alliance Against Cancer.

The Young Alliance Against Cancer is greatly indebted to all participants, to the Klaus-Georg and Sigrid Hengstberger foundation, the Internationales Wissenschaftsforum Heidelberg (IWH) and the Department of Neurosurgery at Heidelberg University. 

We would like to extend an open invitation to junior cancer researchers in all stages of their scientific careers to fill the organization with life! Let us come together and take responsibility for the research field we work in.
