#Biowho? CBioVikings teach you basic statistics and data management!
###By Jessica Xin Hu
In May 2015 [CBioVikings](http://cbiovikings.org) was accepted as the official International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Regional Student Group (RSG) in Denmark. CBioVikings,s short for Computational Biology Vikings, is a non profit organization for students in bioinformatics and computational biology. Our goals are to promote events that enable networking between students and established researchers in the field, and to help train the next generation of computational biologists. Our visions within this field are to 1) promote interaction amongst students, 2) create a platform for scientific knowledge sharing and 3) social networking, with the ultimate goal of boosting the collaborative spirit and helping researchers in their further career paths.
