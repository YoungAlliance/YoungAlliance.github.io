Sometimes scientific news just seem to be taken straight out of a script for the next big sci-fi movie. Take a deadly virus and genetically modify it to specifically target cancer cells. On top oft hat, we make it produce a cytokine (GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) to recruit and activate antigen-presenting cells and thus to further boost our immune system. And it was just approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma.
