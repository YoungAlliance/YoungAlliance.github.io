### By Benito Campos

I know how busy scientist can be. But here is a <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2816%2930003-1" target="_blank"> must-read paper</a>  for cancer researchers: In the latest edition of Cell Metabolism Pedersen et al. show why exercise might reduce tumor incidence. In mice this effect is mediated by NK cells (and not cytotoxic T-cells!) and NK cells in turn, are recruited by adrenalin and IL-6. So, for all the lazy people out there: may we suggest you learn from Pedersen et al. how to save time and stay healthy by consuming epipnephrine - enjoy!
And if you are not in the mood for paper reading today: here is the review by <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21693419-active-life-protects-against-cancer-researchers-now-understand-why-run-day" target="_blank">The Economist</a>.
