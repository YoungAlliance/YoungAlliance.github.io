### By Benito Campos

I know you are busy. But this is a must read paper for cancer reserachers: In the latest edition of Cell Metabolism Pedersen et al. show that exercise in mice reduces tumor incidence. This is mediated by NK cells (and not cytotoxic T-cells!) and NK cells in turn are recruited by adrenalin and IL-6. So, for all you lazy people out there. If you think you will save time and stay healthy by consuming epipnephrine - may we suggest that you read the article by Pedersen et al.? Enjoy!
