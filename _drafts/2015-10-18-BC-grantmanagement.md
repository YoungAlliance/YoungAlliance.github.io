#Sounds boring – but it can save your live (i.e. your grant) one day – A data management plan tool
###By Benito Campos
“What is your data management plan?” Funding organizations are increasingly asking this question to grant applicants. What do you do then? Well, there are a couple of good drafts online. For instance, Sarah Jones et al. put together some [very useful slides](http://de.slideshare.net/DCC-info/supporting-data-m) and developed [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), a software that helps you set up your DMP. Kudos Sarah et al.!
