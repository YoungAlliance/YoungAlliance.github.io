There are two kinds of scientists: The ones who know PhD comics and the ones who have known them for a long time. In any case, you should definitely check out the new <a href="http://phdmovie.com/" target="_blank">PhD Movie</a>. It’s hilarious, and there is much truth in there – you will recognize yourself, your colleagues and your supervisors.  Also, be ready for the second PhD movie coming up next year! (almost 4k supporters on Kickstarter! Whoop! Whoop!).
