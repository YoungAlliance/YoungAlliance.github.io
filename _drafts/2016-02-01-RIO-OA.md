Definitely worth a look: the open-source online <a href="http://riojournal.com/" target="_blank">RIO (Research Ideas and Outcomes) Journal</a> aims at revolutionizing the way we consider research output as such! Ideas, proposals, methods, results and reports are all worth publishing, explains their <a href="http://blog.riojournal.com/2015/08/31/23/" target="_blank">introductory video</a>. All output of one idea can then be combined to a so-called RIO collection, tracking down all aspects of the ‘research cycle’. 

With a very user-friendly search engine for <a href="http://riojournal.com/browse_articles" target="_blank">browsing articles</a> and an interactive viewing tool, on which not only articles stats, but also authors and co-authors can be easily viewed and interacted with, in addition to a tool allowing submitting reviews on articles, RIO Journal seems to have come up with a pretty transparent and innovative instrument. Here’s an example, the very first editorial: (link4)

The fun goes on! with a ‘next-generation’ pensoft writing tool called Arpha (link5), all users are enabled to work together on manuscripts, invite external contributors  and even list them as co-authors. It also enables pre-submission and post-publication peer-reviews. More features can be found here (link6) and here(link). This single collaborative platform ensures a fast and not very expensive publishing process. Have a look at their Blog: (link 7)
