Prepublication in online repositories, which is common practice in other disciplines such as physics, is slowly being implemented in medical science, too. In <a href=" http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719438-about-change-findings-medical-research-are-disseminated-too" target="_blank">this interesting article </a>The Economist describes how heavy-weight science sponsors like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are shaking up medical science and cracking down on pay walls. And while you are at it, please read <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719441-alternative-metrics-extend-concept-citation-beyond-journal" target="_blank"> this interesting companion article </a>on the future of science metrics. It will be worth your while. Enjoy!
