## The Young Alliance Against Cancer

GitHub hosting code for [Young Alliance Against Cancer](http://YoungAlliance.github.io)

Our goal is to educate the next generation of cancer researchers, who will integrate a range of diverse techniques and technologies to generate effective solutions to this pervasive disease.

This GitHub hosts all of the information for our website, which is driven by GitHub pages and uses the Jekyll framework and the Feeling Responsive theme.  Thanks to all of the open-source developers who got us here!
