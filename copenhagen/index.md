The Young Alliance Against Cancer held its 2nd international conference in Copenhagen, Denmark May 22-23 2015. We would like to thank our sponsors <a href="http://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/" target="_blank">Carlsbergfondet</a>, <a href="https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/" target="_blank">FOSTER</a> and the <a href="http://www.ku.dk/english/" target="_blank">University of Copenhagen</a>, as well as all speakers and participants for making the conference a great success.

Based on your feedback and the surges of energy that follow in the wake of spending time with so many inspiring people, we are in the process of re-inventing our web presence. We will kick off our new site with a comprehensive summary of the conference. Please stay tuned for some major changes and make sure you follow @YoungAllianceAC on Twitter.
