On October 16th, the Heidelberg YAAC chapter met for a strategy session and a tweet-writing workshop.    

Our next Heidelberg YAAC chapter meeting will be November 30th!   

In addition, we're working right now on our next conference.  As we've had the last two conferences in mainland Europe, this time we plan to move things across the Atlantic to the United States.
