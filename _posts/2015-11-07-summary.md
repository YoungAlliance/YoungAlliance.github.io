Another great week! Thank you all for following us on Twitter!
My personal highlight this week was the <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/IK-virus/" target="_blank">FDA-approved virus therapy</a>; and then there was this <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/postprandial/" target="_blank">nice paper</a> on the non-trivial task of interpreting gene expression signatures. Turns out that "the effect of postprandial laughter, of mice social defeat and of skin fibroblast localization were all significantly associated with breast cancer outcome". Who knew :)?
   
See you next week!
