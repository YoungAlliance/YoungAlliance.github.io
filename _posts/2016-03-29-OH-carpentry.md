Unless you are Chuck Norris or a computer guru, managing huge data files on your computer will be challenging. Rookies beware, there is light at the end of the tunnel! The <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org" target="_blank">Data Carpentry Organisation</a> has built a non-profit platform aimed at providing free, user-friendly and domain-specific teaching on how to deal with computational data processing. Just have a look at <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop" target="_blank">their genomics workshop! </a> Would you prefer attending one of their workshops in the USA, India, Finland or Australia? You and your institute can even host a Data Carpentry workshop - <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-attend/" target="_blank">have a look here!</a> If you happen to be a more seasoned data manager and would like to share your knowledge, you have the option to engage with users on the <a href="http://discuss.datacarpentry.org/" target="_blank">Data Carpentry forum</a> or even <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/involved-instructor/" target="_blank">get involved as an instructor </a>. You might also want to save the link to their <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> to stay updated. Have a good time at the Data Carpentry!
