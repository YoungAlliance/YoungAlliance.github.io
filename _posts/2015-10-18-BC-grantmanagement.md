### By Benito Campos   

“What is your data management plan?” Funding organizations are increasingly asking this question to grant applicants. What do you do then? Well, there are a couple of good drafts online. For instance, Sarah Jones et al. put together some <a href="http://de.slideshare.net/DCC-info/supporting-data-m" target="_blank">very useful slides</a> and developed <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">DMPonline</a>, a software that helps you set up your DMP. Kudos Sarah et al.!
