Recently, we blogged about a number of tools that will likely ease your research. We feel that some of these tools are quite valuable and will keep updating you as they are further developed.
1) Our number one favorite is still <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/BC-repositive/" target="_blank">REPOSITIVE</a>, a visionary effort to make genomic data accessible. They just released there beta version and it looks great! 
2) We also feel that <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/" target="_blank">Data Carpentry</a> is a fantastic platform to learn and teach data management
3) Don't forget to use the <a href="https://www.openaccessbutton.org/" target="_blank">Open Access Button</a> if you can't download papers you need.

And finally, since research should be fun too, don't forget to read <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/BC-emperor/" target="_blank">The emperor of all maladies</a> or to watch <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/BC-PhDmovie/" target="_blank">The PhD Movies</a>. 
   
We will kepp you updated on these and other exciting projects! Thanks for staying tuned.
