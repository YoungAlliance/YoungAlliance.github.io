###By Steffen Dettling  

As you know, a statistically significant result does not necessarily describe a biologically meaningful effect. The way we are currently using the formal term "statistically significant" has lead to many misinterpretations, implying that a lot of published findings might be incorrect. As UCL pharmacologist & statistician, David Colquhoun pointed out "If you use p-value=0.05 to suggest that you have made a discovery, you will be wrong at least 30 percent of the time". A reason why some fields of cancer science have been stuck for years?    

Maybe a good time to re-read <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124" target="_blank">John Ioannidis’s paper</a> on the subject (which, by the way, has become one of the most widely cited papers ever published in PLoS Medicine).
And if his paper is too technical for you - you can also go ahead and read this pertinent <a href="http://xkcd.com/882/" target="_blank">comic strip</a>...
