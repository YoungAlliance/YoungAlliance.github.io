The new website is finally taking shape.  Right now we're driving this off of [GitHub pages](http://github.com), using Jekyll as our templating engine, and [Prose IO](http://prose.io) as our editing platform.  It's very minimal, but it allows everyone to make changes and see the edits, plus it's all versioned if we mess anything up, nice!
