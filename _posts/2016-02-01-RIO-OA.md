Definitely worth a look: the open-source online <a href="http://riojournal.com/" target="_blank">RIO (Research Ideas and Outcomes) Journal</a> aims at revolutionizing the way we consider research output as such! Ideas, proposals, methods, results and reports are all worth publishing as explained in the <a href="http://blog.riojournal.com/2015/08/31/23/" target="_blank">introductory video</a>. The entire output of an idea can be combined into a so-called RIO collection, tracking down all aspects of the ‘research cycle’. 

RIO offers a user-friendly search engine for <a href="http://riojournal.com/browse_articles" target="_blank">browsing articles</a> and an interactive viewing tool, which displays article stats. In addition, authors and co-authors can be easily viewed and interacted with. RIO even allows submitting reviews on articles. Altogether, RIO Journal seems to have come up with a pretty transparent and innovative instrument. Here is their very <a href="http://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=7547&display_type=list&element_type=8" target="_blank">first editorial</a>.

And there is more! With a ‘next-generation’ pensoft writing tool called <a href="http://arpha.pensoft.net" target="_blank">Arpha</a>, all users are enabled to work together on manuscripts, invite external contributors and even list them as co-authors. It also enables pre-submission and post-publication peer-reviews. More features can be found <a href="http://blog.riojournal.com/2015/10/22/part-1-the-arpha-writing-tool-adding-value-to-rio/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.riojournal.com/2015/09/17/peer-review-at-rio-part-1/" target="_blank">here</a>. This single collaborative platform ensures a fast and inexpensive publishing process. Have a look at <a href="http://blog.riojournal.com" target="_blank">their blog</a>.
