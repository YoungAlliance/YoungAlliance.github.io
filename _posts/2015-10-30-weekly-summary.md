Wow! That was a good start...but also a pretty busy week! Thank you all!
Summary of the highlights of this week in one sentence? Hmm...
You are a tenacious scientist but you also need to know when to relax, so before you turn off the office light, follow <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/BC-repositive/" target="_blank">REPOSITIVE</a> on Twitter, buy <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/BC-emperor/" target="_blank">The emperor of all a maldies</a> online and then, do yourself a favor, and go home to watch <a href="https://youngalliance.github.io/yaac/website/BC-PhDmovie/" target="_blank">The PhD Movie</a>."
