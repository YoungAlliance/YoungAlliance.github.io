How about something to smile about? Here are our top 3 most entertaining scientific publications:

1)
A dead salmon being the subject of a medical research? <a href="http://www.prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf" target="_blank"> This publication</a> about the risks of false positives in functional neuroimaging will not disappoint you (and is our personal favorite!) 

2)
If you were wondering about how to write a scientific paper,<a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume2/v2i5/howto.htm" target="_blank"> this article</a> will introduce you to the art of scientific writing and publishing.

3)
What if pigeons could help us differentiate pathological medical images? <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141357#sec030" target="_blank">This scientific </a>paper tells why radiologists should fear their avian peers.
As always: ENJOY!
