My highlight of the great <a href="http://www.embl.de/training/events/2015/CAN15-01/" target="_blank">Cancer Genomics conference at EMBL</a> Heidelberg was, by far, the Oncology Expert Advisor talk. A few years ago, MD Anderson teamed up with Watson, IBM’s AI machine, to tackle the vast and expanding knowledge in oncology. Watson is currently being trained to digest all available literature on cancer, and advise clinicians on how to treat their patients best. How does it work? Watson deciphers language and runs analytics against a body of data to come up with treatment suggestions (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xcmh1LQB9I" target="_blank">watch this short demo</a>). It is even learning to interpret medical images, such as CT and MRI scans. Watch this short video on how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtyYI7ou2B0" target="_blank">Watson might change medical practice</a>. Are we being a little overenthusiastic here? Don’t think so. If this works, it will be a game changer and in the words of <a href="http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2014/07/31187.html" target="_blank">Dr. Lynda Chin</a>, it will “democratize” cancer treatment. Stay tuned for the beta version. In the meantime, watch this vintage video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI-M7O_bRNg" target="_blank">Watson beating human competitors at Jeopardy!</a> E-N-J-O-Y H-U-M-A-N-S...
