### By Steffen Dettling

In the weekly issue of <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h6326" target="_blank">BMJ</a>, Cath Chapman and Tim Slade tell you how to deal with manuscript rejections. Simply reply to the editor with a rejection of the rejection letter! 
(Imagine how this would play out: "The editor may (then) reply with a rejection to the rejection of rejection. This could lead to an ad infinitum paradox requiring strong nuclear forces to intervene on behalf of the future of scientific progress" (Gen√≠s Cardona)...crazy!
