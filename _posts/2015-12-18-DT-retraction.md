If you haven’t heard about <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction Watch</a>, we recommend you check out their site. Retraction Watch lists research papers that were withdrawn from science journals for any given reason. Why do we feel that you should care? Because the stories you’ll find on the Retraction Watch website mirror work ethics in cancer research and the biological sciences. Retraction Watch also publishes yearly updates to give you the whole picture. Read the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-faq/" target="_blank">FAQs</a> as an intro! And if you think this is too dry, check the entry about <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/09/should-papers-be-retracted-if-one-of-the-authors-is-a-total-asshole/" target="_blank">Stronzo Bestiale and the Nobel Prize laureate</a>, who wrote a paper with his hamster as a co-author!
