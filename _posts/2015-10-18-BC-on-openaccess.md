I hate to admit it, but not too long ago I wasn’t much of a fan of open access. It sounded like a hype that would be over soon. If you look closer, however, OA is here to stay. Clever videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY" target="_blank">this one</a> will help you to appreciate the full consequence of OA. It is not only about making stuff available to everyone but to allow researchers to retain copyright for their work and thus enable other people, public and private, to re-use the material in creative ways. This again will foster scientific discovery and economic growth in the long run. Take a minute to dwell on it. You may be confronted with this topic sooner than you think, e.g. when you have to explain to your funding agency, how your data will be open access.
