###By BC and SD
We are launching our new tweet channel "YAAC meets industry" to explore the synergy between life sciences and industry. We will tweet about venture capital, R&D and start-ups developing tomorrow's oncology hand in hand with leading edge cancer researchers and clinicians. Follow us @YAAC_expanded – and while we are at it, we recommend <a href="https://https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21736176-progress-developing-treatments-makes-oncology-research-favourite" target="_blank">The Economist's report </a>on cancer incidence, its global economic impact and the latest investment trends in CancerResearch.
