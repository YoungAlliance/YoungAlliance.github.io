###By BC and SD
We are launching our new tweet channel "YAAC meets industry" to explore the synergy between life sciences and industry. We will tweet about venture capital, R&D and start-ups developing tomorrow's oncology hand in hand with leading edge cancer researchers and clinicians. Follow us @YAAC_expanded â€“ and while we are at it, we recommend The Economist's report on cancer incidence, its global economic impact and the latest investment trends in CancerResearch.
