We will tweet about venture capital, R&D and start-ups developing tomorrow's oncology hand in hand with leading edge cancer researchers and clinicians. Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/YAAC_expanded" target="_blank">@YAAC_expanded</a> â€“ and while we are at it, we recommend <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21736176-progress-developing-treatments-makes-oncology-research-favourite" target="_blank">The Economist's report </a>on cancer incidence, its global economic impact and the latest investment trends in CancerResearch.
