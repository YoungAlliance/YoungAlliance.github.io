Sometimes scientific news just seem to be taken straight out of a script for the next big sci-fi movie. Take a deadly virus and genetically modify it to specifically target cancer cells. On top of that, we make it produce a cytokine (GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) that recruits and activates antigen-presenting cells and thus further boosts our immune system. And this was just approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma!
